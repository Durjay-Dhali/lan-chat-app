To keep your project dependencies isolated, it’s good practice to create a virtual environment. Here’s how you can do that:

## Create a Virtual Environment:
Navigate to your project directory and run:
python -m venv venv

## Install Flask in the Virtual Environment:
With the virtual environment activated, install Flask:
pip install Flask

## Run Your Flask App:
In your terminal, ensure the virtual environment is active and run:
python app.py
